# Calculator App using JavaScript

This is a simple calculator app built using HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a clear (`C`) button to reset the input.

## Features
- Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface.
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage.
- Clear (`C`) button to reset the input field.
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling and making the app responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for the calculator's operations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd calculator-app
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the calculator.

## File Structure

## How It Works
- The calculator uses a form element with buttons for numbers and operators.
- When you click a button, its value is displayed in the input field.
- The **"Calculate"** button evaluates the expression in the input field.
- The **"C"** button clears the input field.

### JavaScript Logic
- The JavaScript file `calc.js` listens for button clicks and updates the input field accordingly.
- It evaluates the expression when the **Calculate** button is pressed using the `eval()` function, which processes the arithmetic expression.
- The **C** button resets the input field to an empty state.

## Responsive Design
- The layout of the calculator adjusts based on the screen size:
  - On mobile screens, it takes up the full width.
  - On larger screens, it scales down and looks more compact.
